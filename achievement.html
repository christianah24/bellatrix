<h2><u> My Achievement </u></h2>
<p><strong> My name is Famuyiwa Christianah Odunayo,i hail from Ogun state and i come from a family of seven. <br>After my primary school and secondary school education which ended in 2009 and 2015 respectively,I proceeded to write JAMB which i passed in flying colours but i was unable to gain admission into the University due to the condition of our country and Universities.<br> I decided to apply as a teacher in a primary school and i did this work for a year after which i tried jamb again in 2017 and 2018.<br> I finally gained admission in 2018 into Kwara State University to study library and information science. The course is not a childs play but i was able to overcome all obstacles and never for once did i have a carryover in any course till i graduated in 2022. I graduated with first class honours and i went to Abuja to serve my country. <br> After my service year, I went ahead to Film One School of Acting owned and managed by Funke Akindele Bello where i learnt the concept of acting and directing. <br> I graduated with flying colours and i started getting jobs from big and renowned actors.<br> I opened a restaurant named "bolbella" and it is co-owned by my bestfriend and I. I also built a shopping complex in one of the
 best selling areas in Lagos state which comprises of thirty shops in which i took five shops for my personal use where i sell hair assessories in wholesales price. My fiance of about four years proposed marriage to me and that day was one of my happpiest day on earth. We got married a year later and g
I gave birth to two bouncing baby boys,our joy knew no bounds.My husband and I decided to start a joint business, we built a depo where we sell different kind of coca-cola drinks on wholesales price and we had a lot of profits. <br>After four years, I gave birth to another set of twin girls and we decided to close the chapter of giving birth so as to make money to train our children. <br> Due to the stress of childbirth, I decided to make my acting career a part-time one so as to have more time for my home.<br> With the huge profits i am making from my business, I make sure I give back to the society such as donation funds to my church to help the kingdom works,giving to the orphanages and also giving free writing materials to the non-privileged. </strong></p>
